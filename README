## 🧠 What is Cat-System?

**Cat-System** is a next-generation **Windows privacy & performance sculptor** built for users who demand **control, speed, and transparency**.  
It does not promise magic — it **executes calculated, system-level optimizations** using real Windows mechanisms.

Think of it as a **surgical toolkit**, not a one-click placebo. 🛠️

## 🚀 Core Modules (The Engine Room)

### 🛡️ Ghost Protocol — *Privacy Enforcement Layer*
Locks down Windows telemetry, tracking, and consumer data flows at their roots.

- Disables diagnostic & telemetry pipelines  
- Neutralizes advertising & suggestion systems  
- Restricts activity history and feedback loops  
- Applies policy-level registry hardening  

> 🔒 Designed to reduce data exhaust without breaking system stability.

---

### ⚡ System Sculptor — *Resource Rebalancer*
Actively reshapes how Windows allocates **RAM and CPU priority**.

- Analyzes real-time system metrics  
- Optimizes background process behavior  
- Trims safe memory from high consumers  
- Applies high-performance power profiles  

> 🧠 Focused on **temporary but real gains**, not fake “boost” counters.

---

### 🚀 Net Booster — *Network Performance Tuner*
Refines Windows networking for **lower latency and faster resolution**.

- Flushes DNS cache  
- Resets Winsock & TCP/IP stacks  
- Applies TCP responsiveness tweaks  
- Optimizes DNS caching behavior  

> 📡 Targets consistency and responsiveness, not unstable over-tuning.

## 🧩 Architecture Philosophy

- **Language:** C# (.NET 8 / 10 ready)
- **Design:** Modular, interface-based core
- **Execution:** Console-driven, transparent output
- **Approach:** No background services, no persistence, no hidden tasks

Every module is isolated, readable, and intentionally scoped.  
No black boxes. No silent installs.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- Power users & enthusiasts  
- Developers & system tweakers  
- Performance-focused gamers  
- Privacy-conscious Windows users  

If you like knowing **what your system is doing**, this tool speaks your language.
